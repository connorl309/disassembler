# disassembler
A little hobby disassembler.
## Or, a worse version of Ghidra :) 

Written in C++ (but, using mostly C-esque style). 
Plans:

- ELF and PE executable format parsing
- recognize and handle two ABIs (Sys-V and Windows x86/64)
- (graphically) allow interfacing and display of program sections and code

And whatever other things I decide to implement. Thanks :)
