# disassembler
A little hobby disassembler.

Written in C. An attempt to make a basic disassembler (see: Ghidra, IDA, Cheat Engine, x64dbg, etc) that is platform-independent.
Windows, for example, already has an array of utilities to extract information from executable files. I want to roll my own :)
